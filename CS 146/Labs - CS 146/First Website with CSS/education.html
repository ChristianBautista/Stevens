            During Kindergarten, we were playing "Save the Princess" and
            I was the bad guy so I actually stole the princess (which was a doll)
            and FAKE burned her on a plastic baby stove.

            When I was trying to ask my crush out during Recess,
            the entire class practically followed me so I was
            hella pressured but I still did it (at the very end of course).

            There was one day when it was raining really hard and
            I was stuck at school. So, I stayed with my favorite teacher
            and we played poker with Chess pieces.
