                <h2>A Short Paragraph</h2>
                <p>To be honest, there's really not much you need to know about me.
                    I was born September 18, 2001 although my original birthdate was supposed to be a week earlier.
                    (I won't get into that.)
                    Currently, I am a CS Major at Stevens and frankly, I love college.
                    I went to McNair Academic High School which was supposedly #1 in the state.
                    (I highly doubt that.)
                    I love music, whether it's listening to it or actually singing or playing instruments.
                    If you must know, I can play the piano, guitar, ukuele, and drums.
                    (I doubt I spelled uke right.)
                    Anyway, I guess that's all you need to know. After all, it's just a short paragraph.
