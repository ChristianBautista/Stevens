                    During Kindergarten, we were playing "Save the Princess" and
                    I was the bad guy so I actually stole the princess (which was a doll)
                    and FAKE burned her on a plastic baby stove.

                    When I was trying to ask my crush out during Recess,
                    the entire class practically followed me so I was
                    hella pressured but I still did it (at the very end, of course).

                    There was one day when it was raining really hard and
                    I was stuck at school. So, I stayed with my favorite teacher
                    and we played poker with Chess pieces.
